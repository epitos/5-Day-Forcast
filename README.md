# 5-Day-Forcast

## Note
The project can build on the minimum SDK version of 15.

## How to run/ build/ test project
1. Pull down the project
2. Import it into Android Studio
3. In Android Studio, press the Run button. The project will start to build and run)

## What could be done with more time
1. I could have implemented the images that come with each weather, which would have given the app a better visual presence.
2. I could have done a bit of code clean up, as some of the methods generated for the JSON objects are unused.
